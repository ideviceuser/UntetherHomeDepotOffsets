## How to become a Contributor?

Her are two guids on how you can find your own offsets.
If you found them and tested them on your device you can open a issue and I add the offsets to offsets.json.

Guid by [stek29.rocks](https://stek29.rocks/2017/08/23/untether.html).

## Warnings
If you run this on a device that has not yet been tested by a second person, make sure you saved your blobs for a possible downgrade.
If you tested it successfully open an issue and I will add your name as tester.

## Thanks
Special thanks to Tihmstar for creating this untether.
